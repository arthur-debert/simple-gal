After mobile phones and the selfie culture, photographing people invariably means they'll be looking at their phones.
While a specific work , focused on that may be interesting, it makes for way less interesting photos, loosing a richer range of postures, activities and more dynamic result.

This is not about the moral complaint, just that the visual has become so much poorer.
