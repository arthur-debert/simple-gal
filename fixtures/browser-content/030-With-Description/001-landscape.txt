This photograph was taken during the golden hour on a crisp autumn morning. The light filtered through the mist hanging over the valley, casting long shadows across the hillside. It was one of those rare moments where everything aligned perfectly — the clouds, the color, the stillness of the air. I waited nearly an hour for this exact composition, watching the fog shift and settle until it framed the distant ridge just right.
