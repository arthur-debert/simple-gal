A quiet street in the old quarter, taken just before dawn when the cobblestones were still wet from the overnight rain. The lamplight caught the puddles in a way that doubled every shadow and turned the narrow alley into something almost theatrical. I remember the sound of my footsteps echoing off the stone walls as I set up the tripod, the city still asleep around me.
